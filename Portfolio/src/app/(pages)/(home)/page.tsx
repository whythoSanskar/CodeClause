        <p>
          üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Greetings! I&apos;m Sanskar Mishra(whythoSanskar), a passionate web
          developer with more than 1 years of experience. I specialize web
          development in React and Next.js. I&apos;m also a huge fan of
          open-source. I&apos;m currently looking for opportunities to work as a
          Full Stack Developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          üöÄ Over the past year, I have immersed myself in the world of web
          development, constantly expanding my knowledge and sharpening my
          skills. Currently, I am focused on mastering Next.js, a powerful
          React.js library, and have successfully completed several projects to
          reinforce my understanding.
